R2.5: 2019-08-13 Bruce Hill
	Merge pull request #1 from dirk-zimoch/epics7fix to fix version check macros for EPICS 7
	Added support for calcout record.

R2.3.8: 2019-06-3 Michael Brown
	Quiet down this module if no debugging and we get a lot of timeouts.
	Added a brief description of why using two communities is probably a bad idea here.

R2.3.4: 2019-05-31 Michael Brown
	snmp_sess_synch_response might free the PDU and return NULL!  Test for this so we don't crash!
	REMOVE read_all_mibs!!! 
		Minor changes to protect against core dumps, adjust formatting, and deepen the request queue.
		The important bit is that the snmp walk routines no longer automatically read all of the
		available mibs and require explicit read_mib calls.
		(This was necessary to make walking work in the Leviton app, which tries to support
		multiple PDUs, some of which have mibs with identical names but different values.)
